# Hey there, I'm Suraj! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a PhD student at the University of Delaware diving deep into healthcare AI 🧠. I love building smart systems, solving real-world problems, and collaborating on cool projects.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me on a pickleball court 🏓 chasing down every shot or in the kitchen whipping up some Indian dish.

###  My Adventures
- **PhD Student** @ University of Delaware 🎓
- **Research Student** @ Nemours Childrens' Health 🏥  
- Former **Hackabull Co-Director** – Tampa’s largest hackathon with 500+ attendees and $20K+ in sponsorships 👨🏻‍💻

Feel free to explore my repositories, and reach out if you're interested in collaboration or have any questions.
