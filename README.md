# Hey there, I'm Suraj! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a PhD student at the University of Delaware diving deep into healthcare AI 🧠💻. I love building smart systems, solving real-world problems, and collaborating on cool projects.  

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me on a pickleball court 🏓 chasing down every shot like my life depends on it or in the kitchen whipping up some spicy Indian food 🍛🔥.

###  🎯 My Adventures
- **PhD Candidate in Computer Science** @ University of Delaware 🎓
- **Research Student** @ Nemours Children's Health 🏥🤖  
- Former **Hackabull Co-Director** – Tampa’s largest hackathon with 500+ attendees and $20K+ in sponsorships 🎉 

Feel free to explore my repositories, and reach out if you're interested in collaboration or have any questions.
